Pleased to Meet you!
====================

Write a program that asks for your name by saying, "What's your name? ". It should read a string from input and print "Hello, <name>!" where <name> is filled in with the string that was read in.

Recall that ``input(s)`` will print the prompt s before reading---use it here!

**Sample Interaction 1 (brackets are user input):**

**Sample Interaction 2:**

    What's your name? [Sorin]
