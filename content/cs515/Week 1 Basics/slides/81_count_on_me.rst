You can count on me!
====================

Write a function called ``counter`` that prints out the number of times it's been called. The first time you call it, it should print ``1``. The second time, it should print ``2``. The third time it should print ``3``, the fourth time ``4``, and so on. Your code should produce no output unless counter has been called.

Hint: use a ``global`` variable and the global keyword!
