Variable Declarations
=====================

Let's use what we've learned so far to declare a variable according to a specification we give you.

We're in a *workspace*. Below this text, a Python program in the file variable.py declares the two variables num_profs and num_tas.

Add a new declaration for a variable named num_students, with value equal to 45. Click the **Run** button (top left) to check your work; you can do it as many times as you like.

**Please access the challenge 1 folder and nothing else.**

How to use JupyterLite:
=======================

You will be using a simple but incredible tool called ``jupyterlite`` that can run Jupyter Notebook files in the browser and allow live file editing of the python files. In order to write and test your code, follow these steps:

* **Go to the Week1 folder as we are in week 1, within this folder will have challenge folders that are numbered**
*  Type up your python file according to the instructions
*  Go to the ``.ipynb`` file that is also within the JupyterLite app and run the first cell (the first box usually) and click the run button on the top left (it looks like a play button)
*  If your submission fails, then fix your python file and try again **BEFORE YOU RERUN THE CELL** please restart the kernel, and then run the cell again, to restart the kernel simple click the button that looks like a redo button near the top middle
*  If your submission succeeds, this is a sample of what you should expect:

.. code-block:: 

         testOthers (__main__.SimpleTestCase.testOthers) ... ok
         testStudents (__main__.SimpleTestCase.testStudents) ... ok

         ----------------------------------------------------------------------
         Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

         OK 

.. jupyterlite::
   :width: 100%
   :height: 800px
   :prompt: Begin!
   :prompt_color: #00aa42
