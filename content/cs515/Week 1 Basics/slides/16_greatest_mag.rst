We've set up this code challenge so that the ``first`` number will be stored in a variable named first and the second number will be stored in a variable named ``second``.

Write a variable declaration for ``larger_magnitude`` that contains the absolute value of the number that's furthest from 0.

**Sample Input:**

``-9 8``

**Sample Output:**

``9``
