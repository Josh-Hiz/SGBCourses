Cubes
=====

Write a function called ``cube`` that takes an integer and returns that integer cubed (see the sample inputs for some examples). You can pick everything about the parameter name and how you write the body of the function, but it must be called ``cube``.

The code challenge will call your cube function with many inputs and check that it behaves correctly on all of them.

(Hint: if a test fails with ``None != ...``, then you might be missing a ``return`` in your definition.)

**Sample Input 1:**

``2``

**Sample Output 1:**

``8``

**Sample Input 2:**

``1``

**Sample Output 2:**

``1``

**Sample Input 3:**

``-2``

**Sample Output 3:**

``-8``

**Sample Input 4:**

``3``

**Sample Output 4:**

``27``
