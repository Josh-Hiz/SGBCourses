Sum of Ints
===========

In this code challenge, the input is two strings that are expected to be strings of digits. They will be stored in the variables ``numstr1`` and ``numstr2`` as **strings**.

Your task is to define a variable called ``sum_of_ints`` that has the sum of the numbers (as an int) represented by those digits.

**Please access the challenge 9 folder and nothing else**

**Sample Input 1:**

``numstr1`` is '8'

``numstr2`` is '11'

**Sample Output 1:**

``sum_of_ints`` is 19

**Sample Input 2:**

``numstr1`` is '1'
``numstr2`` is '2'

**Sample Output 2:**

``sum_of_ints`` is 3

**Sample Input 3:**

``numstr1`` is '100000'
``numstr2`` is '9'

**Sample Output 3:**

``sum_of_ints`` is 100009
