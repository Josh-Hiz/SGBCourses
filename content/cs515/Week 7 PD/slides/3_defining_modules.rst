Defining modules
================

Define a module ``sort`` in a file ``sort.py``; copy in one of the sorts we wrote in week 11.

Define a module ``main`` in a file ``main.py``; have it call a sort on a list and print out the sorted list.

**Access the Week 7, Challenge 1 folder and nothing else, you will be creating your own files this time**

To create a file using the JupyterLab interface, first **GO TO THE CHALLENGE FOLDER THAT YOU ARE TOLD**, then in the *launcher* tab of Jupyter, scroll down to the *other* section and click "Python File", this will create an ``untitled.py`` file, right click on it and click "rename" and for the purposes of this challenge you will name it "sort" (do NOT change the .py at the end). You will do the same for main.py and so on for the challenges in this week.
