US phone numbers
================

Typical phone numbers in the US are of the form 212-555-1212, i.e., a three-digit area code, a hyphen, a three-digit segment, a hyphen, and a four-digit segment.

Write a regular expression for matching these numbers; use repetition, and make sure to use capturing groups for all three numerical parts.

Test your regular expression carefully---we won't be 'marking' it. Convince yourself you got it right!

(NB that it is probably a bad idea to try to intensively validate a phone number. People often have extensions, and it's possible for numbers to be shorter or longer than the standard form.)
