Pleased to Meet you!
====================

Write a program that asks for your name by saying, "What's your name? ". It should read a string from input and print "Hello, <name>!" where <name> is filled in with the string that was read in.

Recall that ``input(s)`` will print the prompt s before reading---use it here!
