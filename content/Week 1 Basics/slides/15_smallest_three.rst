Smaller of the Three
====================

We've set up this code challenge so that the first number will be stored in a variable named ``a``, the second in a variable named ``b``, and the third in a variable named ``c``. As usual, your code should not define ``a``, ``b``, or ``c``---the tests will define them for you!

Your task is to write a variable declaration for a variable called ``smallest`` that holds the smallest of the three numbers.

**Sample Input:**

``a`` is 8, ``b`` is 11, ``c`` is 17

**Sample Output:**

``smallest`` is 8

    # define a variable smallest
    #   to be the lowest value of input variables a, b, and c
