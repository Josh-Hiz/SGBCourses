Does It float?
==============

.. quizdown::

    ## Which of the following code segments will evaluate to a *floating-point number*?
    (Hint: make the prediction on your own, and test in a python interpreter if you're not sure.)

    > All division with ```/``` yields a float (B), even when division happens <br>evenly (D, F). Combining an int and a float always "promotes" to a float (C, E).

    - [ ] ```10 + 10```
    - [x] ```5 / 2```
    - [x] ```5 + 5.0```
    - [x] ```5 ' 5'```
    - [x] ```11 * 2.0```
    - [x] ```10 / 5.0```
    - [ ] ```5 * 5```
