Welcome!

Hello and welcome to CS 515-A Fundamentals of Computing! We'll be learning the basics of computer programming using the `Python programming language! <https://www.python.org/>`_.

The course materials for this book are from `UCSD CSE8A <https://ucsd-cse8a-w21.github.io/>`_. Joe Politz has graciously allowed us to use his materials, which he constructed with Winny Wilson, Sorin Lerner, Annie Wai, Alex Macedo, Sophia Krause-Levy, and Laura Xu. I gratefully acknowledge their work. It's been made available to me (and y'all) with a `CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/>`_.
