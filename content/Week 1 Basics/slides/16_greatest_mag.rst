Greatest Magnitude
==================

We've set up this code challenge so that the ``first`` number will be stored in a variable named first and the second number will be stored in a variable named ``second``.

Write a variable declaration for ``larger_magnitude`` that contains the absolute value of the number that's furthest from 0.

**Sample Input:**

.. code-block::

    -9 8

**Sample Output:**

.. code-block::
    
    9

.. challenge::
    :tester: /_static/cs515_challenges/Week1/Challenge6/magnitude_test.py

    # define a variable larger_magnitude
    #   use input variables first and second
    #   larger_magnitude holds the largest magnitude value
