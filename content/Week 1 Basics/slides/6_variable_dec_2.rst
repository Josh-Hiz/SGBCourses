Variable Declarations, Part 2
=============================

Write a program in the file ``three.py`` that defines exactly three variables and stores numbers in them. They can have any names you like... but note that Python names should start with a letter and be in snake case, i.e., ``var_name`` is good, but ``varName`` is less good. ``var5`` is okay, but 5var is against the rules.
