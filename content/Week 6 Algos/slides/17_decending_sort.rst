Descending selection sort
=========================

Write a selection sort that sorts the list descending; i.e., find the **maximum** at every step. Call your function ``selection_sort_desc``.

The 'Mark' button runs doctest; write several tests to check your work.

.. challenge:: 

    # define selection_sort_desc (and any helpers you may need)
