Testing for sortedness
======================

Write a function ``is_sorted`` that returns ``True`` if a list is sorted. Make sure that your function does the right thing for the edge cases (empty lists, singleton lists, and lists with duplicates).

Write doctests to check your code; the 'Mark' button will run doctest (so you'll pass if you have no tests, but that doesn't mean your code is correct!).
