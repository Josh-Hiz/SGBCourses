    :question: Suppose use linear search to look for <code>5</code> in the list <code>[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]</code>. How many comparisons will we perform?
    :correct_answer: 6
    :explanation: We'll compare against 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5---which is six elements.

    :question: Suppose use binary search to look for <code>8</code> in the list <code>[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]</code>. How many comparisons will we perform?
    :correct_answer: 2
    :explanation: We'll first look at 5 between 0 and 10, then 8 between 6 and 10. So: we'll make 2 comparisons.
