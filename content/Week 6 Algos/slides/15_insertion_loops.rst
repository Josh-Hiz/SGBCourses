Insertion sort with loops
=========================

We saw a recursive version of ``insertion_sort``. Write a version that uses a ``for`` loop; use doctest to test your results.

.. challenge:: 

    def insert_sorted(v, l):
        if len(l) == 0: return [v]
        # finish this function, using a loop rathe than recursion

    def insertion_sort(l):
        '''
        >>> insertion_sort([10,0,8,5,3,9,2,7,1,4,6])
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
        '''
        # finish this function, using a loop rather than recursion
