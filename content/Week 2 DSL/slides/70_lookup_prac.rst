More lookup practice
=====================

Let's take a look at some more interesting dictionaries we can create using this.

**Integers as Keys**
--------------------

.. code-block:: 

    int_dict = {2:"two", 5:"five", 7:"seven", 9:"nine"}

.. code-block:: 

    str_dict = {"three":3, "seven":7, "nine":9}

You may find it helpful to take some little time to practice creating and accessing **values** from **keys** in these dictionaries in a workspace. After all, practice makes perfect!

In the questions below, we ask what **value** is associated with given **keys** in the corresponding dictionaries.

.. add-css::


.. free-response::
    :question: What is <code>int_dict[2]</code>
    :correct_answer: "two"
    :explanation: Correct answer is "two"
    :question_num: 1

.. free-response::
    :question: What is <code>int_dict[7]</code>
    :correct_answer: "seven"
    :explanation: Correct answer is "seven"
    :question_num: 2

.. free-response::
    :question: What is <code>str_dict["nine"]</code>
    :correct_answer: 9
    :explanation: Correct answer is 9
