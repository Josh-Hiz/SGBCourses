More lookup practice
=====================

Let's take a look at some more interesting dictionaries we can create using this.

**Integers as Keys**
--------------------

.. code-block:: 

    int_dict = {2:"two", 5:"five", 7:"seven", 9:"nine"}

.. code-block:: 

    str_dict = {"three":3, "seven":7, "nine":9}

You may find it helpful to take some little time to practice creating and accessing **values** from **keys** in these dictionaries in a workspace. After all, practice makes perfect!

In the questions below, we ask what **value** is associated with given **keys** in the corresponding dictionaries.

.. free-r:: 
    :answer: \'two\'|\"two\"
    :regex: true

    # Question 1

    What is ```int_dict[2]```?

.. free-r:: 
    :answer: \'seven\'|\"seven\"
    :regex: true

    # Question 2

    What is ```int_dict[7]```?

.. free-r:: 
    :answer: 9

    # Question 3

    What is ```str_dict["nine"]```?
