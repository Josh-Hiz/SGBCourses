Map of the Territory
====================

Here you'll replicate something we've done in the background code for grading exercises.

The input will be several integers on the same line, separated by single spaces.

Hint: Use map, int, split, and input() to get a list of numbers, then use sum to add them up!

Hint: You can refer to previous challenges in this section for help.

Hint: input() reads a whole line of text, not one number or word at a time.

    # read several space-separated integers, sum them, then output the sum
