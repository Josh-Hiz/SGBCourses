List Length
===========

You will define a function ``combined_list_len`` that takes two parameters, both of which are lists and then combines them and returns the length of the combined list.

You can pick everything about the parameter name and how you write the body of the function, but it must be called ``combined_list_len``.

The code challenge will call your ``combined_list_len`` function with many inputs and check that it behaves correctly on all of them. Your task is to only write the ``combined_list_len`` function.

**Sample Input:**

.. code-block:: 

    10 13 25 57
    2 455 238

**Sample Output:**

.. code-block::
    
    7

.. challenge::
    :tester: /_static/cs515_challenges/Week2/Challenge3/test_task.py

    # define combined_list_len
