What is an object?
==================

In the previous step we learned about references. The concept of references and objects go hand in hand. A **reference** is a name that refers to a value's specific location in memory. An **object** is the value that the reference refers to.

In other words, an **object** is simply a collection of data. Hence, we can update our definition of a reference. A **reference** is a name that refers to an **object**'s specific location in memory.

When you assign a variable to equal a list, that list is called an object and the variable stores a reference to that object.
