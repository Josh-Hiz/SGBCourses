Counting evens and odds
=======================

Complete the definition of the function called ``count_even_odd(lst)`` that takes a list of integers lst and calculates the number of **even** numbers in the list ``lst`` and stores it in the **index 0** of a new list called ``count``. Similarly, the function calculates the number of **odd** numbers in the list ``lst`` and stores it in the **index 1** of the list called ``count``. In the end of the function definition, we will return the list called ``count`` which contains two elements that represent the count of even numbers and odd numbers at indices 0 and 1 respectively.

We have written the code to read the input from the user in the background. Also, the code challenge will call your function with many input lists and check that it behaves correctly on all of them. Your task is to only complete the definition of the function as specified.

**Sample Input:**

.. code-block:: 

    8 11 3 78 30 2

**Sample Output:**

.. code-block:: 

    [4, 2]
