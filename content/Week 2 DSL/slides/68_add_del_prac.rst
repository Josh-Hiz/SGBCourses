    # Question

    Suppose we start with the following dictionary:

    ```problem_dict = {'CS' : '515A', 'MUS' : '2A', 'MATH' : '10A'}```
    
    Then, suppose we run the following two lines of code.

    ```problem_dict['PHYS'] = '2A'```
    
    and

    ```del problem_dict['MUS']```
    
    What will be printed when we run ```print(problem_dict)```?
