.. free-r:: 
    :answer: recipients.values()

    # Question

    Recall the ```recipients``` dictionary:

    ```
    recipients = {'Physics': 409, 'Biology': 1473, 'Mechanical Engineering': 1343, 
    'Physical Sciences': 1131, 'Electrical Engineering': 153, 'Business': 131, 'Computer Science': 2870}
    ```
    
    What do you need to replace ```FILL_ME``` in the following code to have the output below?

    ```
    for i in FILL_ME:
        print(i)
    ```
    
    Output:

    ```
    409
    1473
    1343
    1131
    153
    131
    2870
    ```
