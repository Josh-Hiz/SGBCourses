Absolute Values
===============

Your task for this code challenge is to define 3 variables, ``list1`` , ``list2`` , and ``list3``. Each of these 3 lists should contain the elements ``[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]``.

Define these 3 lists such that:

* list2 and list3 contain references that point to the same object

* list1 contains a reference that points to a separate (different) object

Hint: take a look at the third reading.
