List Membership
===============

Write a function called ``is_present`` that takes in two parameters: an integer and a list of integers (NB the first parameter should be the integer and the second parameter should be the list) and returns ``True`` if the integer is present in the list and returns ``False`` if the integer is not present in the list.

You can pick everything about the parameter name and how you write the body of the function, but it must be called ``is_present``.

The code challenge will call your ``is_present`` function with many inputs and check that it behaves correctly on all of them. Your task is to only write the ``is_present`` function.

**Sample Input:**

.. code-block:: python
    
    10
    [1,2,3,4,10]

**Sample Output:**

.. code-block:: python
    
    True
