[OPTIONAL] Prime numbers
========================

A number is prime if it has exactly 2 factors i.e., the number should be divisible by just 1 and the number itself.

Write a function called ``prime_numbers`` which takes as input an integer ``num`` and **returns** a list of prime numbers from the numbers 2 to ``num`` (inclusive). Nested loops will help!

**Function Name:** ``prime_numbers``

**Parameter:** ``num`` - A positive integer up to which we have to look for prime numbers

**Return:** A list of prime numbers from 2 to ``num`` (inclusive).

**Sample Input:**

.. code-block::

    10

**Sample Output:**

.. code-block::

    [2, 3, 5, 7]

.. challenge::

    # define prime_numbers(num)
