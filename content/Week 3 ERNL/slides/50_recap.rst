Recap
=====

* An image is a grid of pixels.
* The coordinate system for an image grid is different from the Cartesian plane.
* The color you see on a screen is color as lights.
* Color is represented as a combination of red, green, and blue.
* The values in the RGB model can be any number between 0-255 which represents the intensity of the color.
* We can represent a pixel as a tuple in the RGB model i.e. red is (255, 0, 0).
* We can represent images as 2D lists of tuples.
