List swap
=========

Write a function ``swap(l, n, m)`` that swaps ``l[n]`` and ``l[m]`` but leaves the array alone otherwise. (Remember to use a ``temp`` variable!)

You should use ``assert`` to make sure that ``l`` is a list and that ``n`` and ``m`` are within bounds. If ``n == m``, you should do nothing.
