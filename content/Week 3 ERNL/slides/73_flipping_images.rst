Flipping images left-to-right
=============================

For the remaining lessons, we are going to learn various ways to define a function that transforms images. We will be using the *flip* image transformation as our key example. You may have experience of using *flip* in applications that edit digital photos. For example, in the following window from the Photos application on my Mac, you can see an option to *flip* the image from left to right.

.. image:: /assets/images/cs515/Week3/image_flip.png
    :align: center

After I click *Flip*, I see the following result.

.. image:: /assets/images/cs515/Week3/image_flip2.png
    :align: center

Let's implement it!
