Doing your times tables
=======================

Write a function ``multiplication_tables`` which takes in as input an integer ``num``, and **prints** out lists with the the first 10 multiples of all the numbers from 1 to ``num`` (inclusive). 

**Function Name:** ``multiplication_tables``

**Parameter:** ``num`` - A positive integer up to which we have to print the first 10 multiples.

**Description:** For each number from 1 to num, the function should print out a list containing the first 10 multiples of the number.

For example, if we run ``multiplication_tables(3)``, your program should print out:

.. code-block::

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]

.. challenge::

    # define multiplcation_tables(num)
