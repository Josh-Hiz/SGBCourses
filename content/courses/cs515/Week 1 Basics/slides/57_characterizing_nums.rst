* "positive and odd" if ``num`` is a positive number as well as an odd number
* "positive and even" if ``num`` is a positive number as well as an even number
* "negative and odd" if ``num`` is a negative number as well as an odd number
* "negative and even" if ``num`` is a negative number as well as an even number
