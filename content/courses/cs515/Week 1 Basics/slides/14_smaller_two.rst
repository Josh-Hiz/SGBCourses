Smaller of the Two
==================

We've set up this code challenge so that the first number will be stored in a variable named ``x`` and the second in a variable named ``y``. NB don't define ``x`` and ``y`` yourself---we'll define ``x`` and ``y`` for you.

Your task is to write a variable declaration for a variable called ``smaller`` that holds the minimum of ``x`` and ``y``. That is, you should assign the minimum of ``x`` and ``y`` to the variable ``smaller``.

**Sample Input 1:**

``x`` is 8, ``y`` is 11

**Sample Output 1:**

``smaller`` is 8

**Sample Input 2:**

``x`` is 12, ``y`` is 5

**Sample Output 2:**

``smaller`` is 5

**Please access the challenge 4 folder and nothing else**
