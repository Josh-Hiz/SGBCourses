Part 1: The Basics of Numbers and Variables
===========================================

Programs do their work with data. Some of the data is text (like a person's name), some is pretty sophisticated (like a file containing audio or video), some of it is yes/no (like whether a box is checked) and quite a bit of it is *numbers*.

Numbers are a convenient place to start studying programs, because we have some familiarity with them already, and at least at first, Python won't violate our understanding of how numbers work and some our experience will help us.

At a Python prompt (at a terminal running `python` in a Workspace), try typing a number and pressing enter. Here's what you should expect to see:

.. code-block:: 

        [user@sahara ~]$ python
        Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 30 2021, 10:22:16) 
        [GCC 11.1.0] on linux
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> 4
        4
        
(We'll skip the noise and just show `>>>` from now on.) We typed in a number, and Python printed it back out at us. Let's try with arithmetic:
