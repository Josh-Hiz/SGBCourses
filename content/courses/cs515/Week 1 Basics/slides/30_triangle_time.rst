Write a function ``triangle_area`` that takes the ``base`` and ``height`` sizes of a triangle and returns its area.

(Reminder, the area of a triangle is ``1/2 * base * height``).

**Sample Input 1:**

``base`` is 5
``height`` is 6

**Sample Output 1:**

``15.0``

**Sample Input 2:**

``base`` is 3
``height`` is 4

**Sample Output 2:**

``6.0``

**Sample Input 3:**

``base`` is 1
``height`` is 2
