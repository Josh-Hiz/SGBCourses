Adder
=====

Define a class ``Adder`` with two methods: 

1. A constructor ``__init__(self, n)`` that takes the number ``n`` and stores it as a field (you can choose the name).
2. A method ``add(self, m)``, that returns ``m + n``, i.e., returns ``m`` plus whatever number was given in the constructor.
