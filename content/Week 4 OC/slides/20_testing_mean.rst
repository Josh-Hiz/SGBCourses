Testing mean
============

Suppose you're writing a function that computes the arithmetic mean (i.e., average, i.e., sum and divide by the length) of a list of numbers. You'd like to test your function. Which examples should you run?

.. challenge:: 

    from test import mean

    # Please don't edit the line above---we need it for the code to work. Write as many doctests as you like for the function `mean` below.

    # Here's one to start you off:

    mean([1])
    # 1.0
