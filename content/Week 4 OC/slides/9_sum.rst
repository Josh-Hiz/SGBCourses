Sum
===

Define a class ``Sum`` with a constructor that takes two arguments, ``left``, and ``right``. The constructor should set corresponding fields on the object, i.e., the field ``left`` should get the value from ``left`` and the field ``right`` should get the value from right. You should set a third field, ``sum``, that is equal to the sum of the two other fields.
